ToDo is fully offline as it does not require internet connection. Also, ToDo is very fast and very light! The size of APK is lighter than 2 MB. It also supports Dark Mode.

Personally, I use ToDo app to save the urls of articles that I plan to read later. So, I can mark them as completed and everything is tracked also saved in the database. So, ToDo can be used in different situations. I hope it can solve your problem and make your life easier!
